# Daily-News-for-Stock-Market-Prediction
In this project, we aim to investigate whether global news headlines published on the Reddit WorldNews channel have impact on stock market movements. On these data, we will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing and feature engineering strategies to build a classification model capable of predicting whether news headline is crucial.
