This process is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it breaks down the text into manageable units for analysis and processing. Secondly, it standardizes the representation of words, enabling consistency in language modeling tasks. Additionally, tokenization forms the basis for feature extraction and modeling in NLP, facilitating tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation._\n",

    "# Words Embedding Techniques\n",
    "Word embedding techniques provide a way to represent words as vectors in a continuous vector space. Word embeddings are numerical representations of words<br> that show semantic similarities and correlations depending on how frequently they appear in a given dataset. Through the conversion of words into continuous vector spaces, these representations enable machines to <br> interpret and analyze human language with greater efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major types of word Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Frequency Bsed Embeddings (Bag Of Words, TF-IDF)\n",
    "    - Bag-of-Words (BoW) is a text representation technique that represents a document as an unordered set of words and their respective frequencies.<br> It discards the word order and captures the frequency of each word in the document, creating a vector representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, commonly known as TF-IDF, is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document<br> relative to a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction Based Embeddings (Word2Vec)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Word2Vec  is a neural approach for generating word embeddings. It belongs to the family of neural word embedding techniques and specifically falls under <br> the category of distributed representation models. There are two neural embedding methods for Word2Vec: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a type of neural network architecture used in the Word2Vec model. The primary objective of CBOW is to predict a target <br> word based on its context, which consists of the surrounding words in a given window.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The Skip-Gram model learns distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space. The main objective of Skip-Gram is to predict context words <br> (words surrounding a target word) given a target word. This is the opposite of the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model, where the objective is to predict the target word based on its context"
